# pubCenter-Dev Center integration


**Important**

-   As of April 1st, 2016, your Microsoft Advertising earnings will be paid to the payout account you’ve set up in Dev Center. You should now manage any updates or changes to your payout account and tax profile only in Dev Center. Please make sure you make any necessary updates before March 31, 2016. For more info, see [pubCenter-DevCenter payout account and tax profile consolidation](pubcenter-devcenter-payout-account-and-tax-profile-consolidation.md).
-   As of December 1st, 2015, [your pubCenter account must be linked to your Dev Center account](#scenario-3-you-have-dev-center-and-pubcenter-accounts-registered-with-different-microsoft-accounts) in order to receive payouts.
-   Your payout history will no longer be updated in pubCenter. To review your payout history going forward, [link your pubCenter account to your Dev Center account](#scenario-3-you-have-dev-center-and-pubcenter-accounts-registered-with-different-microsoft-accounts) and then visit the [Payout summary](payout-summary.md) page in the Dev Center dashboard.

Microsoft Advertising on pubCenter has been integrated into Windows Dev Center.

You might have multiple accounts in pubCenter and Dev Center, and your migration experience will depend on how your pubCenter and Dev Center accounts have been set up. You might fall into one or more of the following scenarios. Please read the details carefully for scenarios that apply to you.

## Scenario \#1: You have a Dev Center account and a pubCenter account with the same Microsoft account, registered in the same country/region


**Example**: You have a Dev Center account registered with \[name\]@outlook.com in the United States. You also have a pubCenter account registered with \[name\]@outlook.com in the United States.

**Result**: Your pubCenter account has been automatically linked to your Dev Center account. No action is needed from you.

-   Reports for all your existing ad units in pubCenter are available in the [Advertising performance report](advertising-performance-report.md) on Dev Center, under the app to which they belong.
-   If you cannot find a particular pubCenter ad unit on your [Advertising performance report](advertising-performance-report.md), we may have been unable to successfully link that ad unit to an app in Dev Center. This can happen if your app is named inconsistently in Dev Center and pubCenter. To see ad units that we were unable to link successfully to your apps in Dev Center, visit the account-level **Advertising performance** report and select the pubCenter app name. To access the account-level **Advertising performance** report, go to your dashboard overview page and click **Advertising performance** in the navigation pane.
-   To manage the payment method and tax details for your existing pubCenter account, you must use pubCenter.
-   The payment method and tax details that are used in Dev Center will be used for your pubCenter payouts as well. Your payment method and tax details can be edited from Dev Center only. This means that:
    -   If your payment methods in Dev Center and pubCenter were different, you might start receiving your pubCenter payouts in a different bank account.
    -   If you don't have a payment method or tax details set up in Dev Center or pubCenter, please set them up in Dev Center and the same payment method or tax details will be used for your pubCenter payouts as well. For more information on managing payment methods and tax details in Dev Center, see [Setting up your payout account and tax forms](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md).
    -   Your pubCenter payouts will happen with the payment method and tax details set up in pubCenter until your payment method and tax details are set up in Dev Center. If they are already set up in Dev Center, your pubCenter payment method and tax details will be superseded by those set up in Dev Center. For more info, see [pubCenter-DevCenter payout account and tax profile consolidation](pubcenter-devcenter-payout-account-and-tax-profile-consolidation.md).
-   Your payout reports are now available in your Dev Center account. For more information on payout reports in Dev Center, see [Payout summary](payout-summary.md).
-   All your app promotion campaigns are now associated with your Dev Center account and you can manage them from Dev Center directly.

> **Note**  You will no longer be able to create ad units or new app promotion campaigns in pubCenter. For information on how to create ad units in Dev Center, see [Monetize with ads](monetize-with-ads.md). For information on how to create app promotion campaigns in Dev Center, see [Create an ad campaign for your app](create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md).

## Scenario \#2: You have a Dev Center account and a pubCenter account with the same Microsoft account, but registered in different countries/regions


**Example**: You have a Dev Center account registered with \[name\]@outlook.com in the United States. You also have a pubCenter account registered with \[name\]@outlook.com in India.

**Result**: Your pubCenter account has been automatically linked to your Dev Center account. No action is needed from you.

-   Reports for all your existing ad units in pubCenter are available in the [Advertising performance report](advertising-performance-report.md) on Dev Center, under the app to which they belong.
-   If you cannot find a particular pubCenter ad unit on your [Advertising performance report](advertising-performance-report.md), we may have been unable to successfully link that ad unit to an app in Dev Center. This can happen if your app is named inconsistently in Dev Center and pubCenter. To see ad units that we were unable to link successfully to your apps in Dev Center, visit the account-level **Advertising performance** report and select the pubCenter app name. To access the account-level **Advertising performance** report, go to your dashboard overview page and click **Advertising performance** in the navigation pane.
-   Your pubCenter earnings data will be converted to your Dev Center currency and reported in Dev Center. However, your pubCenter payouts will continue to happen in the currency of your pubCenter account.
-   To manage the payment method and tax details for your existing pubCenter account, you must use pubCenter.
-   For any new ad units that you create in Dev Center, earnings will accrue, be reported, and be paid out in the currency of your Dev Center account, and earnings for these new ad units will use your Dev Center payment method and tax details.
-   You will need to manage the payment method and tax details for earnings from your new ad units in Dev Center. For more information on managing payment methods and tax details in Dev Center, see [Setting up your payout account and tax forms](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md) and [pubCenter-DevCenter payout account and tax profile consolidation](pubcenter-devcenter-payout-account-and-tax-profile-consolidation.md).
-   Your payout reports are now available in your Dev Center account. For more information on payout reports in Dev Center, see [Payout summary](payout-summary.md).

For information on how to create app promotion campaigns in Dev Center, see [Create an ad campaign for your app](create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md).

## Scenario \#3: You have Dev Center and pubCenter accounts registered with different Microsoft accounts


**Example**: You have a Dev Center account registered with \[name\]@outlook.com. You also have a pubCenter account registered with \[other\_name\]@outlook.com.

    > **Note**  You can link one or more pubCenter accounts to your Dev Center account. However, each of your pubCenter accounts can be linked to only one Dev Center account.

After your pubCenter account is linked to a Dev Center account:

-   Your pubCenter account data will start appearing in the linked Dev Center account within 24 hours.
-   If you cannot find a particular pubCenter ad unit on your [Advertising performance report](advertising-performance-report.md), we may have been unable to successfully link that ad unit to an app in Dev Center. This can happen if your app is named inconsistently in Dev Center and pubCenter. To see ad units that we were unable to link successfully to your apps in Dev Center, visit the account-level **Advertising performance** report and select the pubCenter app name. To access the account-level **Advertising performance** report, go to your dashboard overview page and click **Advertising performance** in the navigation pane.
-   If your pubCenter account was registered in a different country/region than the Dev Center account, your earnings data will be converted to the Dev Center currency in reports.
-   Earnings from your pubCenter account will no longer be paid out using the payment method and tax details set up in pubCenter. If you need to make changes to your payment method or tax details, you will need to do so in Dev Center. See [pubCenter-DevCenter payout account and tax profile consolidation](pubcenter-devcenter-payout-account-and-tax-profile-consolidation.md) for more info.
-   To receive payments for earnings accrued on new ad units created in Dev Center, you must set up your payment and tax instruments in Dev Center. See [pubCenter-DevCenter payout account and tax profile consolidation](pubcenter-devcenter-payout-account-and-tax-profile-consolidation.md) for more info.
-   Earnings from any new ad units that you create in Dev Center will be paid out using your Dev Center payment method and tax details. For more information on managing payment methods and tax details in Dev Center, see [Setting up your payout account and tax forms](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md).
-   Your pubCenter payout reports are now available in your Dev Center account. For more information on payout reports in Dev Center, see [Payout summary](payout-summary.md).

-   Be sure to link all of your pubCenter accounts (with non-matching Microsoft accounts) to the Dev Center account in which you would like to manage them.
-   Do not sign up for a new account in pubCenter, unless you wish to monetize Xbox apps. All your monetization and app promotion needs can now be managed in your Dev Center account.

-   A new pubCenter account may have been created for you, under the same Microsoft account, to link to your Dev Center account with the same Microsoft account. Use the new accounts drop-down in the top-right corner of pubCenter pages to view and manage information for your different pubCenter accounts.
-   To receive payments for earnings accrued on new ad units created in Dev Center, you must set up your payment and tax instruments in Dev Center.

## Frequently asked questions


### Why didn’t I receive my Microsoft Advertising payout this month?

This is usually due to one or more of the following reasons:

-   Your [payout account and tax profile details](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md) were not set up correctly in Dev Center.
-   Your pubCenter account has not been linked to your Dev Center account.

For more info, see [pubCenter-DevCenter payout account and tax profile consolidation](pubcenter-devcenter-payout-account-and-tax-profile-consolidation.md)
### I am unable to create new ad units in pubCenter. What's going on?

Creating new ad units is no longer supported in pubCenter. If you have integrated the Microsoft Ad mediator control in your app, an ad unit will automatically get created on the back end when you upload your app to the Windows Store. Alternately, you could also manually create a new standalone ad unit in Dev Center from your app's **Monetize with ads** page.

### How do I create ad units in Dev Center?

From your app's page in Dev Center, click **Monetization** &gt; **Monetize with ads**. For more information on creating ad units in Dev Center, see [Monetize with ads](monetize-with-ads.md).

### I installed the latest version of the ad mediator extension and I added the ad mediator control to my app. Do I also need to go to pubCenter and create a new ad unit?

If you are using the latest version of the [ad mediator extension](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=518026), we will automatically create a new ad unit for you when you upload your app to the Windows Store. You no longer need to go to pubCenter and manually create a new ad unit. If ad unit creation failed for some reason, you will receive an email with details of recommended next steps.

### I am still using an older version of the ad mediator control in my app and I need to get a new ad unit ID. How do I create ad units?

You can create a new ad unit for your app in the Dev Center dashboard. From your app's page in Dev Center, click **Monetization** &gt; **Monetize with ads**. For more information on creating ad units in Dev Center, see [Monetize with ads](monetize-with-ads.md).

### My ad units got created automatically because I used the ad mediator control, and I confirmed that ads are being served. I also manually created several other ad units from Dev Center. Do I need to do anything more to get paid for earnings on these ad units?

Log in to pubCenter with the same Microsoft account that you use for Dev Center, and ensure your Payment and Tax Instruments are set up accurately. You will receive payout on these new ad units during the first week of the month if the accrued earnings crosses the threshold limit.

### I am unable to create new app promotion campaigns in pubCenter. Some of my app promotion campaigns have also been automatically paused. Is this expected?

You will only be able to create app promotion campaigns in Dev Center going forward. Some of your app promotion campaigns in pubCenter may have been paused as part of this integration. Please create new app promotion campaigns in Dev Center going forward.

### How do I create app promotion campaigns in Dev Center?

From your app's page in Dev Center, click **Monetization** &gt; **Promote your app**. For more information on creating ad campaigns for your apps in Dev Center, see [Create an ad campaign for your app](create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md).

### Where can I see performance data in Dev Center?

From your app's page in Dev Center, click **Analytics** &gt; **Microsoft Advertising performance**. For more information, see [Advertising performance report](advertising-performance-report.md).

### How do I manage my payment method and tax details in Dev Center?

See [Setting up your payout account and tax forms](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md).

### Where can I find payout reports in Dev Center?

See [Payout summary](payout-summary.md).

### I linked my pubCenter account to my Dev Center account, but I am unable to find ad units under the app I used them in. Where can I find them?

If you cannot find a particular pubCenter ad unit on your [Advertising performance report](advertising-performance-report.md), we may have been unable to successfully link that ad unit to an app in Dev Center. This can happen if you used that ad unit in multiple apps, if you used that ad unit in apps that do not belong to the same Dev Center account, or if the ad unit has not been serving any ads in the last few days. To see ad units that we were unable to link successfully to your apps in Dev Center, visit the account-level **Advertising performance** report and select the pubCenter app name. To access the account-level **Advertising performance** report, go to your dashboard overview page and click **Advertising performance** in the navigation pane.

### I used to see my ad units under an app in my Dev Center account, but now I can't find them. What’s going on?

This could happen if no ads served in your ad units for a few days. Go to the account-level **Advertising performance** report in Dev Center and look for data for these ad units.

### How do I find out if my pubCenter account has been linked to my Dev Center account successfully?

If you have the same Microsoft account associated with your pubCenter and Dev Center accounts, your accounts will be automatically linked and you would start seeing your pubCenter earnings reports in your Dev Center account. If your pubCenter and Dev Center accounts were associated with different Microsoft accounts, you will start seeing your pubCenter account earnings reports on Dev Center 24 hours after you link your pubCenter account to your Dev Center account.

### When do I need to complete the linking of my pubCenter accounts to my Dev Center account?

We recommend that you ensure all your pubCenter accounts are linked to your Dev Center account at your earliest possible convenience.

### I am now seeing a new accounts drop-down in my pubCenter Dashboard. What is this?

As part of the pubCenter-Dev Center integration, a new pubCenter account may have been created for you on the back end to link to your Dev Center account. In this pubCenter accounts drop-down, you can choose the account for which you would like to review data.

### I see a slight difference between the data reported in pubCenter and Dev Center. Is this expected?

Yes, there could be a slight difference in the data shown in pubCenter and Dev Center reports. This could be because data in pubCenter is reported in the time zone of the pubCenter account and data in Dev Center is reported in UTC.
