# Set IAP pricing and availability


When submitting an IAP, the options on the **Pricing and availability** page determine what to charge for your IAP and how it should be offered to customers.

## Base price


You must select a base price for your IAP. These price tiers are the same as the price tiers for apps, starting at .99 USD. You also have the option to offer your IAP for free.

## Markets and custom prices


By default, your IAP will be listed in all possible markets, including any future markets that we may add later, at its base price.

However, just as with an app, you have the option to choose the markets in which you'd like to offer your IAP. In most cases you'll want to pick the same set of markets as the app, but you have the flexibility to make changes as needed. You can also set custom prices so that you can charge different prices for the IAP in different markets.

For more info and a full list of the available markets, see [Define pricing and market selection](define-pricing-and-market-selection.md).

## Sale pricing


If you want to offer your IAP at a reduced price for a limited period of time, you can create and schedule a sale. For more info, see [Put apps and IAPs on sale](put-apps-and-iaps-on-sale.md).

## Distribution and visibility


You can determine whether your IAP should be offered for purchase to customers. Choose from one of the following options:

-   **Available for purchase. May be displayed in your app's listing:** This is the default setting and is recommended unless you want to restrict access to your IAP. Leave this option checked for IAPs that will be made available to any customer.
-   **Available for purchase. Not displayed in your app's listing:** Choosing this option allows customers to purchase the IAP from within your app, but the IAP will not be displayed in your app's Store listing. Use this only when the offer is not broadly available, for example during initial periods of internal testing.
-   **No longer available for purchase. Not displayed in your app's listing.** Choosing this option means that the IAP won't be displayed in your app's listing, and no new customers may purchase the IAP. However, **this option is not supported for customers on Windows 8.1 or earlier**. If your app is available on Windows 8.1 or earlier, the IAP will still be available for purchase to those customers. To stop offering this IAP to customers on Windows 8.1 or earlier, you'll need to update your app to remove the code that offers the IAP, then publish a new submission for the app. This is recommended even if your app doesn't target Windows 8.1 or earlier; it's a better experience for your customers if you never offer them an IAP that you've opted to make unavailable.
    
    > **Note**  Choosing this setting, and/or submitting an app update that removes the IAP from your app's code, does not affect any customers who have already purchased the IAP, regardless of their operating system.
