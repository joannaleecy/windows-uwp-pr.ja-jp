# Create IAP descriptions


When submitting an IAP, the info you enter in **Descriptions** step will be displayed to your app's customers. Make sure to consider the description carefully in order to represent your IAP accurately in a way that makes it appealing to customers. You can customize the description for each language in which you offer your app.

## Languages


Before you can enter description info, you need to specify one or more [languages](supported-languages.md). We recommend providing descriptions for every language your app supports.

Under the **Descriptions** section of your IAP’s submission, click **Add languages**. Choose one or more languages from the list and then click Save at the bottom of the page.

You’ll then see these languages listed in the **Add languages** section. Click the language name to provide description info for that language.

You can add additional languages later by clicking **Add languages** again.

## Title


This is the name your customers will see for this IAP. Enter a name of up to 100 characters.

## Description


If you'd like to display more info than just a title, you can enter up to 200 characters here. This field is optional.

## Icon


You also have the option to provide an image that may be displayed when the user buys the product. This icon must be a .png file that measures exactly 300 x 300 pixels.
