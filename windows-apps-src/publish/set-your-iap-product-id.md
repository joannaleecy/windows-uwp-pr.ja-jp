# Set your IAP product ID


The first step in submitting an IAP (in-app product) in the Windows Dev Center dashboard. This is the same identifier that you will need to reference in [your app's code to call the IAP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt219684).

An IAP must be associated with an app that you've created in the dashboard already (even if you haven't submitted it yet). You can find the button to **Create a new IAP** on either your app's **Overview** page or its **IAPs** page.

Once you've clicked the button, you'll see the **Create IAP** page. Here, you'll type in the unique product ID that you'll use to refer to the offer in your code.

Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing a product ID:

-   Customers won't see this product ID. (Later, you can enter a [title and description](create-iap-descriptions.md) to be displayed to customers.)
-   You can’t change or delete an IAP's product ID after it's been published.
-   A product ID can't be more than 100 characters in length.
-   A product ID cannot include any of the following characters: **&lt; &gt; \* % & : \\ ? + ,**
-   To offer your IAP on all devices, you must only use alphanumeric characters, periods, and/or underscores. If you use any other types of characters, the IAP will not be available for purchase to customers running Windows Phone 8.1 or earlier.
-   A product ID doesn't have to be unique within the Windows Store, but it must be unique to your developer account.
