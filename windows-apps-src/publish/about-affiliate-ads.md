# About affiliate ads

If your app uses an **AdMediatorControl** or **AdControl** to display banner ads, you could increase your revenue and ad fill rate by showing Microsoft affiliate ads in your app for products in the Store. When users click the affiliate ads and buy products within a given attribution window, you earn revenue on approved purchases.

Here's how this program works:

* After you [opt-in to the Microsoft affiliate ads program](#how-to-opt-in-to-affiliate-ads) in Dev Center, Microsoft picks ads for top products in the Store to serve to your app. These products may include apps, games, music, movies, hardware, and software.
* Microsoft will serve affiliate ads to your app only when no ads from other ad networks are available. This is intended to help to monetize your unfilled impressions and maximize your ad fill rate.
* When a user clicks an affiliate ad and buys any product in the Store within a given attribution window, you will be paid a revenue share or a fixed commission for the purchase (up to 10% commission). 

    > **Note**  You can get paid for *any* product the user purchases within the attribution window, not just the product that was promoted in your app. For free apps that are promoted in your app, you can earn a revenue share for in-app purchases made by the user within the attribution window.

* Any earnings you accrue in connection with the Microsoft affiliate ads program will be distributed to you in the [payout account you set up in Dev Center](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md), along with your Microsoft advertising earnings.
* To track the performance of the affiliate ads in your app, refer to the [affiliates performance report](affiliates-performance-report.md). You can track daily purchases made through affiliate ads in your app and the revenue share that you received.
