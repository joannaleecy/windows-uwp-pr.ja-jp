## How Developer Mode works
Xbox One has two modes, *Retail* Mode (1) and *Developer* Mode (2). In Retail Mode, the console is in the state that any customer or user of an Xbox One console would use: you can play games and run apps as a user. In Developer Mode, you can develop software for the console, but you cannot play retail games or run retail apps.
Developer Mode can be enabled on any retail Xbox One console. After Developer Mode is enabled, you can switch back and forth between Retail (2a) and Developer Modes (2b).

> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;When you activate Developer Mode on Xbox One, you are opting into Xbox system updates for a developer preview release that includes experimental and early pre-release software. This means that some popular games and apps will not work as expected, and you may experience occasional crashes and data loss. If you leave the developer preview, your console will factory reset and you will have to reinstall all of your games, apps, and content. 

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot activate Developer Mode on Xbox One if you are part of an existing preview program such as the Xbox One Beta program. You can leave an existing preview program by using the Xbox Preview Dashboard app.

4. Open the Dev Mode Activation app.    
    
    > **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;Please make sure that you read the disclaimers carefully. As part of activating Xbox for development, you will be getting early pre-release builds. To play games and apps, you will need to switch to Retail Mode. Sideloaded apps will only work in Developer Mode.

5.  Note the code displayed in the Dev Mode Activation app.

10. After you’ve entered your activation code, your console will display a progress screen for the activation process.
