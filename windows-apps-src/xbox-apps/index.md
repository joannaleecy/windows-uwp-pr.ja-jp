To join our community of independent developers and enthusiasts, register for [ID@Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id). 

This section includes setup steps, a guide through the authentication process, information about installing the required versions of Visual Studio and Windows 10 tools, and the steps to build, run, and debug your first simple application.
